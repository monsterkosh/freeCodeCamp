Responsive Web Design Principles

Media Query: are a new technique introduced in CSS3 that change the presentation of content based on different viewport sizes.

              @media (max-width: 100px) {
              /* CSS Rules */
                  {
                    font-size: 10px;
                  }
              }

Image Responsive:
                  img {
                    max-width: 100%;
                    height: auto;
                  }

Retina Image (for Higher Resolution Displays):

                  <style>
                    img { height: 250px; width: 250px; }
                  </style>
                  <img src="coolPic500x500" alt="A most excellent picture">

Typography Responsive:    body { width: 30vw; }

                    vw (viewport width): 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
                    vh (viewport height): 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
                    vmin (viewport minimum): 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height or width).
                    vmax (viewport maximum): 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height or width).
